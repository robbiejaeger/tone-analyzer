        "report": "The next snowstorm to hit the Front Range will certainly render this report obsolete: The road up to Guanella Pass was a little slippery towards the top. Nothing to worry about. Any vehicle can make it up. Don't think your 4-wheel, all-wheel is immune to losing control. I slid a bit on the downhill as an on-coming vehicle ascended. Being the Saturday after a holiday, the climb wasn't lonely. Myself and another gentleman were the only ones in crampons (most had microspikes or nothing at all). That said, it's far enough into the season where crampons are suitable and not awkward once you get high enough. I cramponed-up once I got to the ridge. I started the climb at 2:00 pm, so I'm glad I had something to carve into that late-day ice. A cautionary tale: Just about everyone reading this knows how to dress and prepare accordingly for winter in the mountains. This is a cautionary tale of identifying and candidly warning folks that shouldn't be at 14,000' in the winter. I had my first encounter with a climber that was dangerously ill-equipped for a 14er this time of year. When they asked me if I was going to the top, I said \"yes\". When they asked if they could go with me, stupidly, in retrospect, I said \"yes\". I encountered them in a white-out on the ridge. Fashion boots with soles and traction like house slippers (not hyperbole), cotton work gloves, water bottle frozen solid, no food, and maybe worst of all, alone. The combination of poor visibility, being in a hurry (to beat sundown), and a difficult language barrier prevented me from identifying the danger signs. They needed a little help to attain the summit. Fortunately, they were fit. On the way down, though, that lack of traction, increased winds, and snowblasting put things in perspective. Had I been in the right frame of mind, I would've told this person to descend immediately (while plenty of folks were still on the mountain)--that they were putting their life in danger. I ended up allowing them to put me at risk. The amount of water, layers, time, and physical assistance I lent them to get down the icy mountain put us both at risk. Being the last folks to descend, made it particularly precarious. I'm not confident this climber (their 1st 14er) would've made it out alone. I was more than happy to help, but I should have helped this young person by insisting they not follow me to the summit. The take home, for me at least, is to help people by being observant of their preparedness and shooting them straight. Mt. Bierstadt doesn't seem like much of a threat to many on this forum. But no mountain is safe in the winter. If you see someone unprepared, don't assume \"oh, it's Bierstadt...\" or \"they'll be fine\". And definitely discourage anyone from wearing Ugg (sp?) boots from climbing a 14er in the winter, or ever for that matter."

We put on traction before heading up the gain the summit ridge as there were icy spots on the trail. Some minor post holing, but nothing required flotation yet. Made it to the top with no issues. The wind was nothing to complain about! We couldn't have asked for better weather. By the time we went down (around 1045) there was snow melting, so we were able to make great time and even found a short glissade opportunity.

I wore microspikes and had trekking poles and they helped greatly on the ascent and descent, but a lot of the people that I saw had neither, so I guess it would be a personal decision on those. On the descent, the sun was out and the snow started getting a little slick as it melted and gave way to mud. Getting off trail led to major postholing, once up to my waist.
