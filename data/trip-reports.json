No need for traction or flotation, although you can expect a hard-packed six inches to foot of snow beneath your toes at any time. As FR 102 climbs higher into the back country, it remains groomed and easily walkable to the FR 102/Pearl Pass divergence. As of this morning around 10AM, I found it completely untouched, and covered in 6 to 8 foot drifts of fine powder snow. The trail is completely buried. I attempted to proceed for about 100 yards in snowshoes. I postholed to my chest even in those snowshoes. Perhaps with a larger party to break the trail, it could be possible. However, traveler beware, the peaks and ridges surrounding Montezuma Basin are VERY loaded with snow. Travel with an avalanche beacon and a few friends. This route is not for the inexperienced right now."

In the AM there were pretty huge ice patches on the road from around 11,000 feet, but may get better in the next couple days if it continues to melt. We drove as far as creek crossing (which was highest car we saw, other than ATVs). At the end of road, snow kept getting deeper, and forced our way through 2-3 feet of snow up into basin. Got up on the NE ridge, and there the wind became vicious. Got to a crux at 13,900. Needed to scramble up something pretty steep, and given that it had snow in it and the wind kept trying to peel us off of it, we called it a day. If had to get up it probably could have, but didn't like what would've happened if there'd been a slip or gust at the wrong time."

NE route to Castle going just below ridge line near top has a lot of loose rock. It can be done, just slowly. The higher ridge line route may be better. The glissading down (mid-am) was slushy and challenging. The loose snow made it easy to lose traction and get going too fast. Some rocks are poking through the slides. Someone recommended that going UP that direction might be easier than the NE route. NOT a good idea. It is steep and with the slushy snow and loose dirt/gravel at the top, it would have been very difficult and physically exerting."

Your mistakes could injure people lower than you. Traverse from Castle to Conundrum is a little loose, but overall in good shape. As other reports indicated, what surprised me the most was the \"descent\" from the saddle. It's very steep, slick and soft. I broke a snow bridge between the rock and the snow field glissading across it. Glissading is very fast right now, the snow is sharp and wet, and it's hard to slow down. Also, some rocks are starting to peak through in the glissade tubes so you might be better off making your own. Mountain axe and spikes are a must here IMO."

There is still a lot of snow to have the option to ascend on and the glacier from the saddle was still accessible without going down too much scree. Microspikes and ice axe highly recommended. It made our trip much more pleasant. I was very surprised that we were one of the only ones with them. It came in very handy for the glacier glissade as the snow was very soft when we got to it around 11am. We had to kickstep facing inward because the glissade couldn't start till further down. This was the sketchiest part. So I was very happy to have our gear. Stay on ridge for ascent to Castle... There is a more obvious trail around to the right that dropped us down into a nasty scree gully we had to ascend to get back to the ridge. Everyone made this mistake and played follow the leader the wrong way. I even knew different after reading many reports but still went against my logic because this other trail looked to be a route.

Glissades are IN PRIME SHAPE. You can glissade down to the lake from the saddle with no ice axe. You can then glissade from just below there (skiers left, climbers right of the lake) down to basically the road, also quite safely. It was prime around 10am. So good. Conditions are still true about the road -- you can drive a decent ways past the first creek crossing but you will encounter avy debris with no great way to turn around.

Snow *does* confound exactly following the standard route down in the valley while ascending to the S Ridge.

Descending, some of the snowfields are well positioned for short time-saving glissades. \"First\" gully (after the chimney) remains a significant rockfall hazard with abundant loose rock and debris.

I was glad to have my yak trax traction device on the couple of snowfields I crossed, and I liked having them in the steep dirt/grass as well. In some places we hiked around the snowfields and lost the real trail, but we managed to find it again further up. This section was very steep, and we moved slowly on both the ascent and descent. Above 13,000 ft there was no snow on the trail. The trail above 13,000 ft isn't always easy to find. I think it's VERY important that you take the time to locate cairns, read and re-read the route description, and study the pictures. This was a painstakingly slow process, but I think it was necessary. This section is dangerous. The 3 people in my group were very fit. Nonetheless, it took us 17 hours round trip--no joke. We left the parking lot at 3:30am, reached the summit about 1:00pm, and then returned to our car around 8:30pm.

We found that if there is no trail across the snow field you should almost always climb up to find it. Whole sections of switch backs were missing. Many of the snow fields are melting at a pretty rapid pace and are even more dangerous as time goes on, especially climbing down from the mountain. You can never really be sure how thick it is, and if it will give away out from under you. Often times there was just enough room between the rock and snow to hike the \"trail\" (as if there is only one.) Watch out for misleading cairns, there are a few that almost tricked us into gaining the south ridge and ascending too early. We hiked in to crater lake and camped on the 2nd, woke up at 4am on the 3rd and my friend and I gained the South Peak at 12:06.

We took the Creek Trail and not the Ditch because the Ditch trail head is not that easy to find in the dark. There were still a TON of cows on the trail. They use the trail to travel which made it muddy, very uneven, and their social trails made the actual trail difficult to stick to at times. We took it slow during these sections to make sure we didn't make mistakes. (We saw the Ditch trail on the way back out where it connects. There is not a great way across the creek, which means you have to get wet, and the exit on the other side to reconnect with the Creek Trail is VERY deep mud). Sunrise was welcomed at the base of the switchbacks below the lake. Hit the lake at about 545am and hung out to get some food, and water. Ascent to the saddle made for quick easy work on the well defined trail. After the saddle there is more snow than previous trip reports lead on. We did not have any traction or ice axes, and ran into several groups who turned around because of this. We were more then comfortable with snow fields so proceeded. There were (3) \"major\" fields we had to cross, mixed bag of about 27 degree to (1) 45 degree snow field. Anywhere from a quick 100 ft across to about 1/2 mile on the last one to K2. I thought the snow was much easier than the rock scramble on the way back to get to K2. If you are not comfortable on snow would HIGHLY recommend traction and an ice axe for the next few weeks at least. K2 was easier to go over than around (as far as stable rocks). We did the summit on the way up went around on the way back. Both passable, but the summit felt better. We hit the Knife edge at about 9am and had to wait about 20 minutes for a group that was descending to come back over. There is plenty of loose rock, and this made for slower than we would have liked travel, between waiting for groups to down climb past us, and making sure we weren't kicking anything down. All around the route is easy to stay on, there are plenty of carins, but there is some room for error as we saw several go too low to dirt patches that at first glance appeared to be trail. Took the ridge proper up the last 100-150ft to the summit because it had more solid rock. Summited at about 1030am and then had an uneventful down climb. Back out to the car at 4pm after the 500ft climb back up (which felt great after 5300ft of down climb!) Side note the bugs are pretty relentless in the daylight bring deterrent!"

If you want to avoid the snow you could turn right at the Daly saddle and take the dry class 4 Ridge Direct route to K2. I saw one guy off the ridge without traction who managed it by climbing cliffs below the ridge to traverse less snow, but much steeper, which seemed extremely unwise. Just get some gear! Speaking of unwise, for any other first-timers, retracing the last section from the summit is very confusing, be careful not to get yourself stuck on a loose ledge like I did, spending 5 minutes on a short 5th-class downclimb picking out the solid holds and praying"

The cornice is no longer overhanging, basically just a vertical wall of snow, so I don't think that is much of a risk anymore. Montezuma basin has a ton of snow, big glissades are still possible. Go get it!"

There is also a few spots where we had to do Class 3 moves on the way up and down. I suggest that others just go over Castle first and resummit it on the way back. This route would only be good for a snow climb. Someone's dog also had a rough time going down the route, so maybe would be wise to leave your dog's at home with a sitter."

On the descent I found the most stable route to be going up the rock that splits the snowfield. Micropsikes would make this easier, but not strictly necessary. Once you get around the corner at the top it is dry to the summit. For those who like a little class 3 action, I went around the southwest ridge on the way up and it was totally dry and pretty reasonable climbing. Stick to the boulder stuff and avoid the loose scree. The trail is in good shape down Castle all the way to Conundrum. The snow you can see on the south side of Conundrum is only sticking to the wall and not impeding the trail. For those who want to run up the couloirs my personal opinion is not to bother. The snow is still mostly their from the lot up to the saddle, but it is slushy and loose by 10. Better for glissading and not really worth the skiing. An axe will hold in most it, but anything near the top and you'll be punching in to rock."

Remnants of the big cornice (now more of a vertical snow wall) still guard most of the top, but there is a reasonable exit (~50 degrees) on climber‘s right. We used crampons, an alpine axe, and a second tool, and found all to be very useful. Snow conditions were definitely on the firm side, with some places accepting only front points and pick placement, and others allowing for the occasional shaft plant and shallow (couple inches) step-kick (for reference, we were in the couloir from about 8:30-9:45). There were several deep runnels in which one could stem if desired for a little relief from the otherwise rather steep and sustained climb (>40 degrees for the entire length of the couloir, and >45 for a good bit of it as well). Other notes: -We saw numerous hikers without any snow gear. Their way to get past the lower headwall was to cross it as low as possible and get onto the talus slope between the two lobes of the snowfield. From that talus \"island\", they then still had to cross a bit of snow near the top to get onto the standard (NE ridge) Castle trail. That crossing is short, tracked out, and not very steep, but if one were to slip on it in the firm morning snow, they‘d be looking at a ~500 foot ride all the way back down to the base of the snowfield. Just FYI. -The snow slope below the C/C saddle was melted out about 150‘ below the ridge (see second photo). We didn‘t go this way, opting instead to just descend the standard trail after summitting Castle from Conundrum, but it looked loose and unpleasant. We did see a few people go both up and down that way throughout the day, and also some some good-sized rocks dislodged from the scree slope. Needless to say, folks without an ice axe did not go down this way, but went back over Castle instead. -Thanks to LiquidShadow and others for providing the info that encouraged us to attempt this route so late in the season!

Goats were active as usual, so watch out for dropped rocks! Wonderful mountain - go out and get it while weather permits. EDIT: FWIW, I didn't think the slope from the amphitheater to the saddle was as bad as it's made out to be. And this is coming from someone who thinks the descent off the back side of the Daly saddle on Capitol is one of the worst parts of the route. Truthfully, it's a class 2 trail. Yes, a bit steep and tedious in places, but there's really nowhere I could think of where a slip would result in much more than a bump on your backside. The key is to go right at the split near the bottom of the slope, and avoid getting sucked into the steeper, looser terrain in the left-hand gully (we did make this error on the way up, but avoided it on the way down, and the other option was totally fine)."

I did climb it without a rope with a spotter, I would have been a lot more comfortable pitching this out. New sling is placed on top of this section.

The road was fine, and the main trail was tolerable without them (would have been easier with them though), but when I left it to bypass the Kelso avy danger, I was sinking up to my waist and seriously hating life. Once I regained the trail past Kelso, things were fine again. I wore microspikes all day and was glad I had them. The trail along the small ridge before the switchbacks up Grays had some side-sloping snow that wouldn't be hard to slip off of, especially on the descent when tired. Some people may prefer crampons here; I saw two people on this section wearing them. When descending Torreys, the bypass from the saddle had lots of snow and didn't feel safe. I took a few steps on it and then changed my mind. I ended up climbing partway up Grays before crossing on a less steep slope and meeting back up with the switchbacks. The safest route would definitely be to go all the way back up and over Grays. I only saw three other people all day, so I'm not sure what all the cars at the trailhead were for; maybe it was the people staying in the cabins along the road. Don't make the same mistake I did. TL;DR - I recommend snowshoes, microspikes, and axe. Be mindful of avy danger on Kelso and the Grays bypass."

Somehow lost the trail around the White Rock Wall near 13K (stay right, not left). This led to some exposed scrambling to regain the ridge. Put on crampons and pulled out the ice axe at this point. Snow on the SE aspect was luckily nicely consolidated and allowed me to regain the ridge and the route. After regaining the ridge / route, continued along the route fairly easily. Some sections are rock, some are snow, but both in decent shape and no ice. The climb up to the Knife Ridge was probably the most interesting part. Snow was starting to get soft which made the climb up a challenge. I was able to find decent leverage using a combination of snow and rocks off to climbers left, but this made the climb a little more exposed. Earlier start the better. Knife Edge is in great shape. I was able to traverse across it on the left side. Snow pack was in great condition. White Rocks were clear of snow and ice. Climbed the last section to the summit staying to the left as there was great snow that made it easy to climb the final 100'. From Torreys, did the standard traverse over to Gray's.

Once out of the gully, it was smooth sailing with a lot of hard styrofoam frozen snow. The long summit ridge was mostly dry rock with very little snow. The official summit is hidden as you approach on the West Ridge until a false summit is gained. From there it's another 1/4 mile of 3rd class scrambling to reach what can't be more than 20 feet higher. In fact, both the satellite and barometric altimeters on my gps showed that I was within a few feet of the summit elevation, so I called that good enough and turned tail. I left the car at 10:30AM and got back to it at 8:25 PM. That was a HUGE day."

Put on flotation at this point. Followed the trench that Brad put in (thanks!) Scott Gomer Creek drainage is for the most part frozen solid. There are sections that are not, so if you lose the trench like I did not the way back at night, just be cautious of your route. Ditched flotation at the gully. The standard route starts out going up the gully to climbers right. Found snow piled up waist deep at points, so crossed over the gully and ascended staying climbers left until regaining the path up. I found traction to be helpful, as it is a mix of scree, rock, snow and ice. Microspikes are fine. After exiting the gully, snow is wind scoured and makes an easy walk. West ridge is a mix of rock, ice and snow. Traction recommended."

Road is snow packed, but very doable to the usual winter closure a little over 8 miles up. From the parking lot, I wore spikes up the road and got to the summer TH in 50 minutes (pushing a touch). Trail down to the creek has had a bit of traffic since last weekend’s storm. Spikes were fine for that. Once I left the Bierstadt trail for Evans, the snowshoes went on and the suffering began. No one had been up there, so it’s a fresh (albeit mediocre) trench. Once I rounded the corner, I was tired on trenching through the deep snow in the willows, so I tried out the creek bed to see if it seemed frozen. It was easier going for sure, so that’s where my trench goes. One section of creek tried to jump out and grab me on the way down, so beware if you follow my trench. Be light on your feet and ready to jump in a spot or two. Since I was all the way down in the drainage, I ended up starting up the gully on climbers’ left vs the trail that goes up climbers’ right. I came down closer to the trail on climbers’ right. Snowshoes stayed on to the top of the gully. Between the gully and the start of the W Ridge, snow is firm and supportive, so spikes were great again. Wore my spikes along the ridge as well. Oh and beard got very icy, so there’s a photo of that too so you can visualize what your beard may look like."

Both are sufficient ways we went up and around the creek in the a.m and followed the creek in the p.m but use at your own discretion because there was signs of postholing into the creek a bit and you could hear water running but it all held for us fine and was dodgable. Snow coverage was consistent all the way to the base of the gully some wind scoured and some mid shin to knee deep. No flotation needed just just the willows are tedious.Both paths meet back up at the base of the gully where from there it had a touch of snow at the base but was almost snow free till the exit. There was patchy snow in the rocks and grass in the gully which made it slick but now traction needed. it make it worse because it was just soft.

That said, the descent off Bierstadt is rather loose and tedious, but otherwise is as expected - a total blast.

As we parked at the tip of the 13,300' switchback on the road (to do the Tour de Abyss), I feel conditions down to there are worth reporting as well: All of the switchbacks and road are dry. You can find ways to cut the switchbacks if you wish, there's obvious social trails through many of them. The final switchback is rather steep and loose and requires walking quite a ways down the road to find an area that you can walk down without feeling like you're going to topple a landslide on top of yourself.

The trail was pretty icy from the start, with increasing ground snow up to about a foot beyond the Keyhole. Despite the snow and ice, the route was pretty easily passable up to the Keyhole, and we saw a few other climbers enjoying the bluebird day as much as we did. Nobody was making much progress behind the Keyhole, however. A few turned around at the Keyhole, citing high winds, though we found the winds to be fairly mild. One person reported that the bulls-eyes marking the route above 13,000 feet were buried in the snow, though we had no trouble finding them. We decided to turn around a few hundred feet beyond the Keyhole because the new, unconsolidated snow masked all objective hazards and gave virtually no purchase, making the route a bit sketchy. It was more than we personally cared to test, though we all agreed that with slow and careful movements, the route was likely passable at least to the Trough, which we also thought would be passable.

Any vehicle can make it up. Don't think your 4-wheel, all-wheel is immune to losing control. I slid a bit on the downhill as an on-coming vehicle ascended. Being the Saturday after a holiday, the climb wasn't lonely. Myself and another gentleman were the only ones in crampons (most had microspikes or nothing at all). That said, it's far enough into the season where crampons are suitable and not awkward once you get high enough. I cramponed-up once I got to the ridge. I started the climb at 2:00 pm, so I'm glad I had something to carve into that late-day ice. A cautionary tale: Just about everyone reading this knows how to dress and prepare accordingly for winter in the mountains. This is a cautionary tale of identifying and candidly warning folks that shouldn't be at 14,000' in the winter. I had my first encounter with a climber that was dangerously ill-equipped for a 14er this time of year. When they asked me if I was going to the top, I said \"yes\". When they asked if they could go with me, stupidly, in retrospect, I said \"yes\". I encountered them in a white-out on the ridge. Fashion boots with soles and traction like house slippers (not hyperbole), cotton work gloves, water bottle frozen solid, no food, and maybe worst of all, alone. The combination of poor visibility, being in a hurry (to beat sundown), and a difficult language barrier prevented me from identifying the danger signs. They needed a little help to attain the summit. Fortunately, they were fit. On the way down, though, that lack of traction, increased winds, and snowblasting put things in perspective. Had I been in the right frame of mind, I would've told this person to descend immediately (while plenty of folks were still on the mountain)--that they were putting their life in danger. I ended up allowing them to put me at risk. The amount of water, layers, time, and physical assistance I lent them to get down the icy mountain put us both at risk. Being the last folks to descend, made it particularly precarious. I'm not confident this climber (their 1st 14er) would've made it out alone. I was more than happy to help, but I should have helped this young person by insisting they not follow me to the summit. The take home, for me at least, is to help people by being observant of their preparedness and shooting them straight. Mt. Bierstadt doesn't seem like much of a threat to many on this forum. But no mountain is safe in the winter. If you see someone unprepared, don't assume \"oh, it's Bierstadt...\" or \"they'll be fine\". And definitely discourage anyone from wearing Ugg (sp?) boots from climbing a 14er in the winter, or ever for that matter."

The road to the Kite Lake trailhead was a little washboarded in places, but otherwise in great shape. The trailhead parking lot was full before 6:00a (but also in great shape). Everything else was in fine shape - except my legs and lungs! It was about 36 degrees as we headed out. We left the trailhead around 6:15a, a good hour before the sun rose in the gulch. It was pretty much a bluebird day, except for the frustrating layer of haze from the fires in the Pacific NW. We finally got some clouds in the early afternoon, but the weather was truly a non-factor. We topped Mount Democrat in just over two hours; after a hard climb, the summit was pleasantly cool, not too windy, and not too crowded for a holiday weekend. The descent back down to the saddle was steep but manageable. After a short rest, we headed up the southwest slopes of Cameron/Lincoln, making the peak of Mount Cameron by 10:30a and the summit of Mount Lincoln around 11:00a. The summit was crowded by this time (dogs and people), and smoke diminished the otherwise-spectacular views. Quandary loomed to the north, with Grays & Torreys just visible through the haze to the northeast; the Climax Mine is a blight on the landscape to the west. After a quick snack and a last look at the roof of Colorado, we shouldered our packs for the descent. Our tired feet made the trek down seem as long as the way up. We pulled back into the trailhead just before 1:30p ... mission accomplished!"

I expect it will be status quo to park here after more snow kicks in. Didn't even think about the wind yesterday, in retrospect it was amazingly very tame. Temps probably in the teens or 20s. I hesitate to even mention this but I had a series of snafus and then delay messing around to practice with a new ice axe, resulting in a very late start on the actual trail. Still really wanted to complete the loop even though wasn't on Dem summit till 2:30 / 2:45 ish. The late afternoon walk over to Cameron was nice, and bouncing over to Lincoln was trivial. Bross kind of sucked though. It was getting pretty dark when I summit and the walk down the trail of loose scree by headlamp was not fun. This probably goes without saying, but don't hike down Bross in the dark unless you know the trail already!! I learned my lesson!

I was nervous about the having to self arrest on this. After exerting too much energy here, I moved to the glissade path, still gripped about the possibility of an avalanche. That being said, it was a slightly easier descent this way. Beyond that, everything was relatively straightforward. There are a couple snowfields you have to cross on the side of Bross (summit still closed to the public) that you need to be vigilant of. If you go early in the day like I did, don't bring snowshoes.

It was pretty much a bluebird day, except for the frustrating layer of haze from the fires in the Pacific NW.

We topped Mount Democrat in just over two hours; after a hard climb, the summit was pleasantly cool, not too windy, and not too crowded for a holiday weekend.

After a short rest, we headed up the southwest slopes of Cameron/Lincoln, making the peak of Mount Cameron by 10:30a and the summit of Mount Lincoln around 11:00a. The summit was crowded by this time (dogs and people), and smoke diminished the otherwise-spectacular views. Quandary loomed to the north, with Grays & Torreys just visible through the haze to the northeast; the Climax Mine is a blight on the landscape to the west.

Nearly full-moon start at 3:40 am gave way to brutally foggy conditions in the a.m. All three of us made the classic error of turning too soon to face El D. The consequence is a lot of unnecessary (but fun) climbing of cliffs and fins and some traverses of hard-ice snowfields. One of our group summitted TWO pinnacles on the ridgeline before finally finding the summit block where the other of us had wandered. Traversing W to E past the Gendarmes was a nightmare as we couldn't see where we were going (visibility was about 75 feet) -- consequently a lot of backtracking, upclimbing, downclimbing and \"unnecessarily difficult\" route choices ensued. On the ridgeline, we got a slight break in the clouds, were on the coxcomb before we realized it and upon arriving at what was billed as the most difficult climbing of the traverse, kind of shrugged it off as not as difficult as what we had endured up to that point by wandering off route so many times. Saw (and heard) some guys coming up the N slopes route to Mt Wilson, but we exited the summit to the South before they got there. Descent of Mt. Wilson to South STILL has a lot of snow on it. it's suitable for late morning glissading even without axes. Ascent up that route, particuarly earlier in the day) would be unpleasant enough without crampons I don't think I would have continued if we had ascended that way. Not too steep, just lots and lots of snow, followed by loose scree and dirt once onto the the 'dry' bit of the pitch. The traverse was a great adventure, but was drawn out in some not so fun ways by the severely restricted visibility. I wonder if the Gendarme passage would have been more evident coming E to W?"

No water and no snow. It's pretty easy to navigate through the talus field to the point where you begin your vertical ascent up the south slope that leads to the saddle between Kismet and Sneffels. That slope is by far the most difficult part of the hike because it's steep and loose. By staying to the left, you can stay in some larger rocks for part of the ascent, which I think is easier than scrambling through the scree. Once you reach the saddle, you turn left and head up the infamous chute, which I thought was considerably easier than the ascent leading up to it because the rocks in the chute are much larger and more stable. There's still a little bit of snow in the chute, but it's easy to avoid. Shortly before reaching the top of the chute, turn left and climb up and through the notch. I found that part to be rather awkward (especially coming back down), but there's no exposure, so it's not dangerous. Once through the notch, it's an easy scramble up the large rocks to the summit. Sneffels has one of the most enjoyable summits I've experienced. Although quite small, it has several big flat rocks that make great places to sit and enjoy the views.

Snow was continuous on 6/29, but getting thin and soft for the last 200ft at the top and might be melted out by now. Snow in the basin between North Eolus and Glacier Point was bottomless much with knee to waist deep postholing. The standard approach to Eolus from the Twin Lakes junction had some snow in the lower basin below the SE face. Both approach slopes to the high basin and ridgeline between Eolus/N Eolus were solid snow. I used microspikes and ice axe, some may prefer crampons. These slopes make for a good glissade.

The best part of the hike is about 3 miles in (lots of waterfalls). Sunlight: I took the very steep gully from Windom‘s notch. Be very careful if you do so also. Crossing the boulders to get to Sunlight can be tricky as they can be surprisingly loose despite their size. I got thrown off one- ouch. The gully sucks. Follow the cairns to the top, and do not do the final hops if you have never bouldered, are alone, or don‘t have ropes. I didn‘t do it, and my pride is still in tact."

Would still consider taking an Ice Axe for protection, and having crampons would allow for fast ascent to saddle. If trying to stay on rock, there is a lot of Mud and slick/loose rock to mess with. This can make the summit a little more sketchy. Having an axe also allows for a fun descent down to the basin in sections. Early morning the snow is firm, and you can avoid dangerous post holes, by 1:00 PM the snow is super soft and careful snow travel to avoid post holing to your waist is needed."

The turn off into the basin isn't too hard to find, but there is actually some decent knee-deep snow in the forest as you head up towards treeline. There are several slide paths to cross on the way up as well. The existing snow is very faceted and unconsolidated. Overall the route is fairly safe right now due to the lack of snow, but another decent storm will likely return this route to it's more typical avalanche prone form. Expect an 8-10 mile and 4,000-4,800 vertical day depending on where you are able to park. We did not take snowshoes, just microspikes. They were quite helpful crossing the ice flows on the road, and also on some icy sections higher up.

Where it is deepest, near timberline, several stretches are shin deep and occasional pockets are knee deep. This doesn't require floatation, but it is tiresome to walk through. Spikes were useful in the upper gulch because of patches of sun and wind crust on steeper terrain. The trail is easy to find below timberline.

We took the \"do not take this route\" route to the left (when headed down) of the suggested gully. Had I known conditions prior I would have had my helmet with me and insisted that everyone else in the group do the same. The rock walls are very loose and not able to act as the support I thought they would when looking down the gully initially. Expect a lot of rock tumble. This part was very slow going. If taking this route communicate with the person below and make sure they are clear of the gully before starting down; there is no way to avoid rock fall through this section. The NW face is definitely a lot more interesting with a much more dramatic view of sunshine and redcloud compared to the standard route.

A couple of signs were broken/turned along the route near the Silver Pick mind and because we got started early, we got off route in the dark. On the way down, my wife and I adjusted the signs and built some cairns. Just some beta - you will pass a sign that reads \"Stay on road for the next 1/2 mile.\" After that sign the road will curve sharply left and there will be a small trail in the rocks at a sign and cairn that goes right. Go right to stay legal. When you reach the top of that little trail at a small clearing with grass, look for cairns that will lead you to the other side of a small patch of snow and to continue up the rock trail.

The route to the Prow was a little hard to spot, we ended up climbing a few sections that could have been avoided. Once past the Prow, the final pitch was fairly straight forward!

Took this 60 year old climber a total of 9 1/2 hours and I didn't dally much. Snow slows the descent a little. Saw some elk several times. Road in good shape to Stewart Creek Trailhead, water crossings easy, but not sure how deep."

There was still some snow in the gullies making it hard to choose the best route to drop down to the talus field. The suggested gully to ascend up in the description of the NW route, when going the opposite direction, was unpassable due to slick snow. We took the \"do not take this route\" route to the left (when headed down) of the suggested gully. Had I known conditions prior I would have had my helmet with me and insisted that everyone else in the group do the same. The rock walls are very loose and not able to act as the support I thought they would when looking down the gully initially. Expect a lot of rock tumble. This part was very slow going. If taking this route communicate with the person below and make sure they are clear of the gully before starting down; there is no way to avoid rock fall through this section. The NW face is definitely a lot more interesting with a much more dramatic view of Wunshine and Redcloud compared to the standard route. I am glad we took it, but unless you have basic route finding skills, a helmet, and experience with some class 3+, I'd strongly suggest going back over redcloud for the decent.

Still some water running in the red gully, but very easy to avoid. To find the traverse itself, look for a large tower on the left about 3/4 up the gully with a dirt path to the right of it. Follow this path right across the gully to find the start of the traverse. Once on the traverse, once again fairly easy to follow, but I would recommend having pictures of the route. When you get to the class 5 move, be extremely careful of rock fall above. The move itself is not too bad but the knife edge right after can be mentally challenging. Not a lot of great foot holds. Once you ascend to the final pitch, stick to the exposure side for a less difficult route or stay right for a much more challenging class 4 wall. All hand and foot holds are party of 3 had were solid, but of course you should always test them. Once at the Needle, do not expect a breeze down to Broken Hand, still a very hard and exposed descent. Extremely fun day and conditions were amazing, as always feel free to message me on Twitter or IG for more specifics."

This makes it class 4 IMHO - At the top 1/3 of the red gully there are two snow sections that can be ascended. It may be possible to avoid the first section by climbing off to the left as well. I had altitude problems and had to turn back right at the base of these sections so I'm not sure if microspikes would have been sufficient here or crampons are required. I talked to a couple of other climbers who had been up 7/4 in crampons and they were ambiguous about it -- so at any rate spikes seem a bit sketchy.

I put on crampons at the upper stream crossing and kept them on to the summit and back. I postholed a few dozen times on the way out, but would not have bothered with snowshoes if I had them.

Snow on Broken Hand pass, some lose, some firm. Crampons and ice axe highly recommended, especially for the descent. East gully only has snow at bottom or in deepest parts. Small snow patches on the rib between east and west gully make that the most difficult part, and probably render the 4th class variation a more favorable option (our party of 5 split up on the ascent, but all chose to descend the 4th class variation to avoid the slick gully crossover).

My notes: trail was sort of difficult to find on North Ridge, I did my own route finding to get to the the ridge itself and tried to leave some cairns for future hikers. Take standard trial to boulder field and head up is my best recommendation. Once at the colouir, I would be careful to not head too deep in because there is this nasty spot of water that would lead to a decent fall if you tried to go up it and were not successful. Once in the colouir, bang a right (almost immediately) to head up top. Work your way up from here and eventually you will find yourself on the headwall with some grass/moss and more class 3 scrambling. The ridge itself is a blast but has lots of exposure with some loose rock along the way with mostly class 4 climbing. Rock is 100% dry but can agree with previous post that moss will wet your boots in the morning. Towards the top, you can stick right and avoid climbing the final pitch of the ridge. Challenger: Will post this on Challenger as well, but figured there is probably a lot of cross reading. Route from peak down is just s--t, no other way of putting it. If you are starting from the lake, pass the top streams and locate a small rock cliff, this is where the new trail starts. You will notice yellow/orange trail markers here.

Watched a few people kick down rocks in the middle, so it is probably safer as well. Down climbed the first gully since there were so many people. Again, if you are ok with the exposure, I recommend the first gully. If not, stick to the left side of the second gully. Cairns mark the entrance to both. Ps - The hike down from challenger point is grueling with all of the loose rock. RMFI is building a new trail and it is much needed. Thanks!"

There was also a large ice patch in the middle on the descent that must have melted/ re-froze with the current temperatures. Forced me to do a self arrest. The NW ridge is holding good snow and makes for an easy ascent outside of the notch you have to climb through. The stream that feeds the waterfall at Willow lake is currently frozen. There are notable cracks in it and ice made a large cracking noise while I was crossing on descent. Be extra careful on crossing as ice may not be completely stable with current weather.

Class 1 hold true for the approach to Willow Lake- there were a couple spots that were so icy we cut a switchback or walked adjacent the trail for a few steps, but the trail is easy to find and in great condition. With sunrise Sunday morning we headed up towards the North slope of Challenger Point. Navigation and finding the \"rock rib\" are easy once you locate the obvious shoot. After a good pace up to about 12,500', we came to a near halt and postholed for a couple hundred feet. Finally approaching the notch, we hit some good crusty snow/ ice and could easily walk with crampons. Once on the ridge, the finish was easy (although the exposure and awkwardness from walking relatively flat rocky ground with crampons was a little sketchy). Took about 3 hours to climb from the lake to the summit with perfect weather. Beautiful, blue sky day with views of the Crestones, dunes, valley, Pike's Peak, and the whole world it seemed. The avenue to Kit Carson was visible but looked quite skinny and exposed in one spot. On the way down, we were able to glissade the majority of the chute with frequent self-arrests (we both slipped at least once and legitimately had to self arrest before zooming away down the shoot). Conclusions -Crampons and ice axe are a must. We saw a couple parties had made it to the ice around 13,400' by postholing and then turned back. -We probably would have found crunchier snow pack in the shoot for the ascent and could have made better time than postholing on the other side (near the rock rib). -There were 2 layers of snow on the face. Any deeper or added layer would come with serious avalanche risk. Check snow conditions and recent storm history if climbing in early November. -This is a lot of elevation to climb down back to the parking lot. Very satisfied with the decision to hike in and camp rather than day hike."

Micro-spikes didn't cut it. We retreated to climb another day. We'd summited before in better conditions, so we knew which way was up. We saw two climbers descending the couloir from CP. Don't know if they had axes/crampons but they looked pretty wobbly, cautious, and slow, and they made it. Loose rocks flying down are a real danger.

Had the goal of summiting both Challenger & Kit Carson, but with the late start knew one, if not both could be in jeopardy. However, we got lucky with some outstanding weather all the way until early afternoon. The Willow Creek Approach was pretty uneventful all the way up to the Lake, and our group of eight stopped a few times here and there for water/food/picture breaks. Started getting into snow just before crossing the waterfall around 11,500'. Snow was pretty firm still and in areas micro spikes came in very handy. As we got closer to the lake, the snow depth kept increasing and due to this area seeing more direct sunlight, postholing started to become a problem here and there, however snow shoes probably wouldn't have been worth the extra hassle. We ran into a hiker the day before who summited Kit Carson, and he recommended leaving the snow shoes at home. The weight and space saved was more beneficial for me, some others may have preferred to have them. We stopped for lunch and to rest our legs once reaching the lake around 10am, taking in its beautiful views. At this time there was still not a cloud to be seen in the sky, and very mild wind at around 5-15mph. From here, staying on the trail became a little more difficult at times. There's still plenty of snow around the lake covering the trail, and the trail was a lot less traveled, not leaving a whole lot of foot tracks to follow. However, we managed due to knowing the general direction we needed to go. Once getting around the lake to the base of the North Slope, we decided to ditch our bags. This turned out to come back to bite us! We looked at our trail notes/pictures to be sure we correctly followed the gully....and then accidentally left them behind in the bags. The North Slope was almost completely covered in snow, waist deep in areas, and route finding proved to be very difficult with absolutely no tracks to follow. We managed to correctly follow just to the right of the gully up to around 13,000', however made the mistake of veering to our right, instead of staying close to the gully from there. Had we remembered our notes, this would have been avoided! Not knowing at the time we had screwed up, we kept climbing, reaching what I'll guess was probably 13,800' until noticing our mistake. By this time it was around 12:30pm, and menacing clouds/wind rolled in very quickly, which kept us from attempting to correct our route to summit. Due to our late start, the sun had softened the snow on the North Slope pretty well, making crampons not a necessity, but I still found use of crampons very beneficial along with my trekking poles. Had we started earlier, crampons and potentially axes may have been a necessity. The group was pretty disappointed we weren't able to summit, especially because of how close we were! However, this being our first time ever attempting to summit in true mountaineering/snowy conditions, we were still proud of ourselves and how far we got. Hoping to come back this summer with more favorable conditions & take down both Kit & Challenger in one day like we had hoped to! Safe climbing everyone."

The road to the upper trailhead gets a little snowy but I have a Tiguan that made it up there. There's a bit of snow on the road once you get toward the upper TH. Past that the road towards the lower lake becomes a sheet of ice taking up the entire/road trail, but there's some snow covering parts of the ice, however I'd recommend still bringing microspikes for that part. After that theres a little bit of snow here and there, I think the deepest snow was maybe 7-8 inches and was only in small patches. On the switchbacks theres a bit of snow but nothing that made it difficult at all, the slopes were pretty dry. Once we got near the ridge the wind got INSANE. We had to keep stopping to duck behind rocks to catch our breath. (Mountain forecast called for 10 and 15mph winds but they were way, way higher than that). We reached the ridge around 1:30 and took our time going up since the wind was so crazy it was literally knocking us down if we weren't holding rocks to stay standing. From here there's very little to no snow to the top. We took a few quick pics and took off down the East Ridge thinking it would be less windy (it wasn't lol) Couldn't find the trail into the woods so we had to cut down in the easiest direction to get back to the car. Most of the east ridge was completely dry, even in the trees there was only maybe an inch or so.

Definitely bring a face mask, goggles, gloves etc because taking the gloves off for 30 seconds made my hand go numb"

Above treeline, there's not much snow. I post-holed a few times off trail, but never above my knees, and it wasn't enough to wish I had brought snowshoes. The ridge was almost completely dry. There was a dusting of snow that kept me alert, but it wasn't an issue as long as I was careful. I didn't wear traction in either direction. I went up the class 4 chimney on the crux wall and descended the class 3 bypass. Both options felt like climbing in summer. Get that \"snowflake,\" people!"

Keep this weak layer in mind as this gully continues to fill this winter. Stuck mostly to thinner snow/rock climbers right. Hourglass had more snow than anticipated, ranged from thin, non-cohesive powder over the slabs, to waist deep wallowing. No instability. Any bare rock is iced over from daily melt cycle. Crux of the hourglass is an unavoidable ~15' section of thick, well-bonded ice which we hit at noon. Crampons,axe and knowing how to use them on real ice is absolutely required until more snow accumulates. Would not recommend hourglass route to inexperienced parties until better conditions.

The 1st gully up from the road holds un-consolidated snow and is not going to melt out anytime soon, bring at the bare minimum micro-spikes for this section. The west ridge has basically no snow, watch for some verglass at the start of the hourglass. Nothing has changed significantly in the hourglass since the last condition report in October. There was still ice and snow climbers right, but climbing the slightly 4/5 class rock to climbers left was dry. I inspected the ropes, they are in OK condition but do not rely on them solely. We used them as a guide on the way down but never put our weight on them. The upper gully is as it normally is.

The trail is packed snow to about 12,500 and then it was a mix of snow and bare ground. I didn't use traction on the way up but I used spikes for the steeper 1000' down off the top and then took them off for the rest of the day. I could have gotten by without them but it made going down a little faster."

        "report": "Gorgeous day, although felt like a long haul between treeline and summit (multiple false summits play mental tricks). Stunning views at the top, particularly the views to the north after seeing twin lakes the whole way up. Spikes were helpful on some slick sections above treeline. Trail windblown and easy to see in spots above treeline but not too well defined in others. Some hikers sort of crossed over from the South to North Mount Elbert trail in the last push. All roads lead to Rome though. Below treeline: if you haven't read the 14ers.com trail description and are just checking the old South Mt Elbert trail as defined on Google maps (as I was doing), it's easy to take the \"wrong\" turnoff since it comes first and a number of tracks lead that way. From the hiker's perspective, not a disaster because there are tracks the whole way and it meets up again eventually with the correct route, but it is closed for restoration so it's best to avoid (and sorry that I didn't). On the way down, the correct route is more obvious because more tracks head that way. Finally, most are probably aware but there's also the option to hike the CO trail up to the 4WD trailhead instead of hiking on the 4WD road (which is snow covered and also not a bad walk currently). The CO trail option would add an extra ~2 miles RT. I hiked on this trail for a while after getting back down the mountain since there was still some daylight left, and it's very pleasant (of course). Overall, the packed trail will stay intact this week with no new snow forecast in the near future, and winds were not awful up there (and look even milder tomorrow). I'd say it's a great time to go for it!"

I'd estimate temps around 5 degrees near summit. No traction needed on the way up, nor floats, but micros were a very useful carry for the way down. I did not ever get my axe out, but there is enough continual hard snow toward the top where it could become absolutely necessary in the near future.

We followed a snowshoe trail that we believe followed the actual trail (thank you for whoever made these tracks!) all the way to the meadows before this trail began to go up a gully to the right (East side of meadows). Looking at the map, we thought the trail continued more west of this area, so we diverged from the snowshoe trail and began to make our own tracks. We found it difficult to find the junction for the North Halfmoon lakes trail, but eventually found the Massive trail just above the avalanche debri area.

CRAMPONS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE FIRST MILE OF THIS ROAD. The remainder of the road to the Mount Antero junction (2.8 mi from start) contained light but continuous snow, not deep enough to post hole. From the trail junction to treeline the snow became deep enough to posthole to the thigh and it made for a bit of misery on the way down. From treeline onward, the snow thins out. There is enough along the shelf road that you'll want to keep traction on and watch your step through the exposed parts. Above 13,000ft there is hardly any snow. The summit ridge was simple enough to manuever, and the snow field between the last tower and the final stretch is meager. Note: the normal avalanche runouts along the shelf road weren't an issue when we climbed, due to lack of snow. The forecast for avy danger on the western aspects of the Sawatch peaks was zero (per CAIC). After another foot or two of snow accumulates there will probably be more avy danger on the route."

From that point, you can see the entire route, first south on one ridge and then west on a second ridge that leads up to the summit. Although the second ridge looks daunting, it's actually pretty easy because the route takes you behind the prominences that make it look so difficult, and it's not very steep. I found the first ridge to be more challenging because it's steeper overall. The descent is pretty straightforward, but be careful going through the trees, particularly on the steep slope leading back to the saddle, because it's easy to drift to the north and miss the old mining road. I got caught in a nasty hail storm and lost my bearings, so I had to backtrack uphill to get back to the route.

Road from the antennas to the point where you turn north to the old mining road is icy in the ATV tracks, but no traction is required. Once you get on the trail proper, the north side of the ridge is in shadow all day so you can walk it without traction. I used poles to help as the trail and cairn disappear from time to time resulting in some hip deep post holing. The first to gullies are fine for now, but the third is definitely questionable. The group i fell in with and the others turned south and went vertical at this point, scrambling up the gully to avoid the worst spots. Once on the ridge, there is plenty of route finding to be had, but the course is straightforward. We descended down the same gully to save time as the nightly freeze was setting in and we wanted to make it back to the low trailhead before the road became icy. Overall, the summer route is likely going to be safe until the next major storm, at which point pushing over \"Mt Tipper\" will be the better bet. Recommend gators and micro spikes.

The trail is covered in a pretty much perfect layer of nicely packed snow up to a bit past the junction with Elkhead Pass. I put my spikes on in the parking lot and would say that's a good move. Once you're \"on\" Belford and the trail starts getting steep there are some switchbacks that have been getting enough sun to put the snow through the freeze-thaw cycle, so it's pretty icy. There are a couple of steep snowy slopes to traverse where poles will come in handy. The summit of Belford (i.e. the rocky tower at the top) is completely dry. The traverse over to Oxford is in fine condition. Getting up to Oxford is a cake walk, getting back up to Belford it's a little snowy, but nothing treacherous. It was pretty darn windy everywhere above treeline and especially on the summit(s). Probably consistently 20mph most of the time with some strong gusts that forced me to brace myself with my poles. Overall, it was a \"safe\" day to hike the two, but could be miserable if you don't have the right layers. Also, getting down Belford on the icy rock steps was pretty miserable. I fell on my ass at 4 times, and can say that at least 2 of those times I was being as careful with my foot placement as humanly possible - it's just an awkward mix of icy, gravely rock in a lot of spots. Poles come in handy here."

Crossing the stream: This was a bit dicey since there was so much slippery ice that could not bear much weight and broke as soon as you put your foot on it. Use your trekking poles to test the ice before putting your foot down on it. We found a sturdy crossing further downstream from what's recommended here. Summit: Cold and windy, but not too bad. Lots of fog. Limited visibility. I ran into a couple of hikers who turned around at 13,000 because the fog limited their visibility beyond their acceptable margin of risk, but it must have cleared by the time I got there because it wasn't too bad. Snow & ice: You're walking on dirt and rock for most of the beginning, but once you get above tree-line you're going to encounter pockets of hard-packed snow and ice, and there are also areas with soft, powdery snow that's knee-deep. I brought trekking poles, micro-spikes, and snow shoes, but never used any of them. My partner used trekking poles most of the way. Incline: 4,500' of elevation gain in 4 miles is no joke!

Cottonwood trailhead is pretty good, a bit of snow and ice, but no issues making it the whole way. Had an AWD vehicle with moderate clearance. The trail from the turnoff for Columbia had not been traveled on anytime recently and is unbroken. The part of the trail that is broken curls around the Harvard section of trail and then presents a split off back towards Columbia. Snowshoes would help greatly on the approach. From the boulder field to the summit, spikes are all that is necessary, though an ice axe would have been helpful in some spots. I only had poles and they were a help on that steep grade. My partner and I tried breaking the Columbia trail from the boulder field to the Harvard junction on the way back, but our route was somewhat circuitous. We did have a GPS and map/compass, but the trail wasn't entirely discernible. While I am sure this may be general knowledge, don't be fooled by the stats on this hike like I was, it's a pretty exhausting hike in the current conditions, and the trail from the boulder field to the ridge is steep and about as fun as completing your taxes. It may be worth waiting until the new trail is done. On the bright side, the avalanche danger looked minimal at worst. Happy hiking!"

There are also numerous places along the route where you can get access to water. After you leave the Horn Fork Trail and head east toward the west slopes of Mt Columbia, the trail is easy to follow through the forest. As you leave the trees, there's a big snow field that's relatively easy to cross. It looks like you can get around it if you prefer to avoid it altogether. From that point, the trail, if you can really call it that, is brutal because it is not maintained, it's extremely steep, and it is mostly just loose dirt and gravel. It's a tough ascent that makes a 1.5 mile trip seem twice as long. Plan for more time than you would for other ascents of a similar distance. Once you gain the ridge and start heading north, the going is much, much easier. The final pitch is comprised of large boulders that are pretty easy to navigate.

I suspect the monsoon rains this summer are responsible for further deterioration of the trail (such as there ever was a real \"trail\") Agree with the most recent report, the downclimb is not hard; however, the 50' scree section following is pretty bad. I was there yesterday with 6 experienced hikers; all of them echoed the comment that this is far more dangerous and exposed than Longs. The hiker with the least problems was the one who donned microspikes. Poles are a must. Take this section very slowly and carefully, that's a long, steep scree field to be tumbling down."

One fellow hiker commented, \"This feels more exposed than Longs.\" The best strategy seemed to be staying high and grabbing onto the rocks, but either way, it's not for the faint of heart. Overall this hike felt harder than Yale/Massive/La Plata, so take care out there! Poles are definitely helpful."
